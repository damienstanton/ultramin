`ultramin` is a theme designed to be minimally colorized, so that you can better focus on control, logic and flow rather than mentally jumping between colorized keywords.

It is based heavily on the [Apex](https://github.com/apex/apex-ui) theme for Atom, as well as [Nofrils](https://github.com/robertmeta/nofrils) for Vim.

Enjoy! And please do file any bugs or suggestions on the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/damienstanton/ultramin/issues).
